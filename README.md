# EyeBeast

C group project for the **Programming Languages and Environments** class at FCT-UNL.

This is a clone of the game **Eye Beast** (originally developed by Chuck Shotton for the Macintosh) made in C using the [wxWidgets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets) library.

We implemented the following **extra feature**:

There will be various green crosses, grouped by chunks, drawn "on the floor" 
of free cells of the board. If the player manages to cover all the crosses 
with boxes, while evading the monsters, he/she will be rewarded with a 
"prize". In this case, we decided that the prize is having the monsters 
frozen for a few seconds, making them harmless. The player can (and should)
then take advantage of it, by trapping them while they are no threat.
